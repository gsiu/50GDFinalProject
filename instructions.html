        <h3>How To Play</h3>
        <p>On an Android 2.x device, when the Sky High app is launched, a start page appears.<br />
           Touch the balloon with the red X to exit the game, touch the trophy to view a list of high scores, or touch the green play button to start the game.</p>
           
        <h4>Objective/Goal:</h4>
        <p>The goal of the game is to fly the balloon has high as possible into the sky without popping it.<br />
           The balloon loses a life if it collides with any enemy objects flying in the sky. Once the balloon is out of lives, it pops and the game is over.<br />
           Your score reflects the number of seconds the balloon has been flying in the sky, plus additional points for any power-ups you got. If your score is high enough, it is added to the current list of top high scores.<p>
         
        <h4>Game Controls:</h4>
        <p>Make sure the accelerometer on the device is activated. <br />
           Move the balloon from left to right or up and down by tilting the device. (If you are running the game via python on a computer, use the arrow keys to control the balloon.)</p>
        
        <h4>Enemies:</h4>
        <p>Move the balloon to the left, right, up, or down in order to avoid enemies. You lose a life when the balloon collides with an enemy. Points are also subtracted from your score, and the balloon moves downwards slightly, indicating backwards progress.
           If vibration is activated on the device, the device vibrates when the balloon collides with an enemy.<br />
           Enemies include airplanes, missiles, and flying saucers.<br />
           Be aware that the higher your score, the more frequently enemies appear.</p>
           
        <h4>Power-ups:</h4>
        <p>If the balloon collides with a power-up bonus (a golden star), 10 points are added onto your score. The balloon will also increase its vertical speed for a second in order to move away from enemies.</p>
